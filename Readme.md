## Development Recording Notes

During development, I recorded up to 30 minutes of the coding process to capture how I worked with an LLM. Key activities include:

- **Prompting for code structure**: Asked the LLM how to modularize preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation steps.
- **Feature extraction guidance**: Used LLM to recall `librosa` functions for MFCCs, chroma, spectral features, and zero crossing rate.
- **Debugging and testing**: LLM suggested fixes for audio padding, noise augmentation, and LightGBM training errors.
- **Iterative improvement**: Explored alternative model choices and cross-validation strategies with LLM assistance.
- **Real-time experimentation**: Tested small snippets for audio augmentation and spectrogram visualization before integrating into the pipeline.

This recording provides a **raw glimpse of the development workflow** and demonstrates how LLMs were used as active coding partners.
